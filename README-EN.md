[RewardedVideoActivity](./app/src/main/java/com/zplay/playable/mediationmopub/RewardedVideoActivity.java) is a rewarded video sample code. When you get your mopub an unitID, and make sure the [adapter](./app/src/main/java/com/zplay/playable/mediationmopub/ZPLAYAdsRewardedVideo.java) in your project, you will get rewarded video from ZPLAY Ads.

[InterstitialActivity](./app/src/main/java/com/zplay/playable/mediationmopub/InterstitialActivity.java) is an interstitial sample code. When you get your mopub an unitID, and make sure the [adapter](./app/src/main/java/com/zplay/playable/mediationmopub/MPZPLAYAdsInterstitial.java) in your project, you will get interstitial from ZPLAY Ads.
